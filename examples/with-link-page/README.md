## The idea behind the example

This example is an optimization for the usual `Link` component. Now, we include a special page prop with the dynamically imported page.
Then it'll use that to fetch the component and page will be cache-able across multiple builds of the page.

In this case, we need to analyze the `Link` statically. That's the only requirement of this feature.
